Data types in SQL specify the kind of data that can be stored in columns and variables. Choosing appropriate data types is crucial for:

Data integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
Storage efficiency: Optimizing space usage.
Query performance: Facilitating fast and efficient data retrieval.
Common SQL data types are categorized as follows:

1. Numeric Data Types:

Exact numeric:

int: Integers (whole numbers) with a typical range of -2147483648 to 2147483647.
bigint: Larger integers with a range of -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
smallint: Smaller integers with a range of -32768 to 32767.
decimal(p,s): Fixed-point numbers with defined precision (p) and scale (s).
numeric(p,s): Same as decimal, but can store very large numbers.
Approximate numeric:

float(p): Single-precision floating-point numbers with up to 7 digits of precision.
real: Same as float.
2. Character and String Data Types:

char(n): Fixed-length character strings of length n.
varchar(n): Variable-length character strings with a maximum length of n.
text: Large text data with no specified length limit.
3. Date and Time Data Types:

date: Stores calendar dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
time: Stores time values (HH:MM:SS).
datetime: Stores both date and time values.
timestamp: Similar to datetime, often used for recording timestamps of events.
4. Binary Data Types:

binary(n): Fixed-length binary data of length n.
varbinary(n): Variable-length binary data with a maximum length of n.
5. Other Data Types:

boolean: Stores logical values (true or false).
XML: Stores XML data.
JSON: Stores JSON data (in some SQL dialects).
